# Using Composers

At the core of `stylings` are style **composers**. 

Composers provide a great way to express and compose styles.

```tsx
import { $flex } from "stylings";

$flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2);

// This represents the following CSS:
// display: flex;
// flex-direction: row;
// align-items: center;
// gap: 1rem;
```

## Chaining composers

Composers are infinitely chainable.

They can be assigned to variables and reused.

If a reusable variable is later used, it can still be chained to make styles more specific.

```tsx
import { $font } from "stylings";

const $baseFont = $font.family("Inter, sans-serif").size("1rem").lineHeight(1.5);

// In other file
const UILink = styled.a`
  ${$baseFont.underline}
`;
```


## Naming conventions

All composers are named with a `$` prefix. This is to make them easily recognizable and clearly indicate that they are chainable.

If you're exporting composers from a file, it is recommended to also add a `$` prefix to the name of the variable.

```tsx
export const $formField = $flex.horizontal.alignStretch.gap(2);
```


## Reading values out of composers

> [!note]
>
> You will rarely need to do that manually. Composers are automatically compiled when used, e.g., as a part of styled-components.

The main purpose of composers is to collect styles and later output them if needed.

To read values from composers, you can:
-  call its `.compile()` method
-  or call the composer as a function (`styled-components` does this automatically)

If you need to read values from the composer:

```tsx
const $styles = $flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2);

$styles.compile();
// above is equivalent to:
$styles();

// both will output:
[
  "display: flex",
  "flex-direction: row",
  "align-items: center",
  "gap: 1rem",
]
```
