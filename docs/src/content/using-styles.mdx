# Using Styles

At the core of `stylings` are style **style composers**. 

Style composers are objects that collect desired styles and can be used to generate CSS.

There are several built-in style composers: `$flex`, `$grid`, `$animation`, `$colors`, `$frame`, `$font`, `$shadow`, `$common`, `$transition`.

```tsx {3} {5-9}
import { $flex } from "stylings";

$flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2);

// This represents the following CSS:
// display: flex;
// flex-direction: row;
// align-items: center;
// gap: 1rem;
```

## Chaining style composers

Style composers are infinitely chainable using their **modifiers**.

Some modifiers can be used without arguments, e.g., 

```tsx /horizontal/ /center/
$flex.horizontal.center;
```

Some modifiers require arguments, e.g., 

```tsx /gap(2)/
$flex.gap(2).horizontal.center;
```

You can use the same modifier multiple times (new modifiers will override previous ones), e.g., 

```tsx /horizontal.center/
$flex.horizontal.center.horizontal.center;
```

is technically valid and is the same as 

```tsx /horizontal.center/
$flex.horizontal.center;
```

## Using style composers with `styled-components`

Style composers can be directly passed to styled components.

```tsx /$flex/ {12} /ListOfItems/
import { $flex } from "stylings";

function Items() {
  return <ListOfItems>
    <div>Item 1</div>
    <div>Item 2</div>
    <div>Item 3</div>
  </ListOfItems>
}

const ListOfItems = styled.div`
  ${$flex.vertical.gap(2)}
`;
```


## Naming conventions

All composers are named with a `$` prefix. This is to make them easily recognizable and clearly indicate that they are chainable.

If you're exporting composers from a file, it is recommended to also add a `$` prefix to the name of the variable.

```tsx /$/
export const $formField = $flex.horizontal.alignStretch.gap(2);
```


## Manually getting final CSS out of style composers

> [!tip]
>
> You can skip this section as you will rarely need to do that manually. Composers are automatically compiled when used, e.g., as a part of styled-components.

To read values from composers, you can:
-  call its `composer.compile()` method
-  or call the composer as a function, e.g `composer()` (`styled-components` does this automatically)


```tsx /compile()/ /()/
const $styles = $flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2);

$styles.compile();
// above is equivalent to:
$styles();

// both will output:
[
  "display: flex",
  "flex-direction: row",
  "align-items: center",
  "gap: 1rem",
]
```

> [!note]
>
> Under the hood, composers behave both as functions and objects. Calling them as a function is an alias for calling `.compile()`. 
>
> This is needed because of how `styled-components` work. They accept functions as part of styles and then resolve them. If in the future, styled-components will, for example, support some API that allows custom objects to be used as styles, it will be possible to remove this distinction.
