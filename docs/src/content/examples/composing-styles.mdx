# Composable, reusable styles

As composers are infinitely chainable and composable objects, they can be used to easily create reusable styles.

Let's say we want to define some shared font styles. 

We can first define some basic font styles, and then continue composing them into more specific styles.

```tsx
import { $font } from "stylings";

const $baseFont = font.family("Inter, sans-serif").lineHeight(1.5).antialiased;
```

We now defined some core font style. Now we can compose it into more specific styles.

```tsx
const $header = $baseFont.size("2rem").lineHeight(1.25).bold;
const $label = $baseFont.size("0.875rem");
```

Using `$baseFont` and continuing chaining, we were able to create more specific styles.

Note that we can override styles defined previously. For example, we called `.lineHeight(1.25)` on `$header`, which means we override the line height defined in `$baseFont`.

We can now organize our styles into a single object, and reuse them across our app.

```tsx
import { $font } from "stylings";
// We define some shared font styles
const $baseFont = font.family("Inter, sans-serif").lineHeight(1.5).antialiased;
const $header = $baseFont.size("2rem").lineHeight(1.25).bold;
const $label = $baseFont.size("0.875rem");

export const typo = {
  $copy: $baseFont,
  $header: $baseFont.size("2rem").lineHeight(1.25).bold,
  $label: $baseFont.size("0.875rem"),
};
```

And use them in our components.

```tsx
const UIBlogPostParagraph = styled.p`
  ${typo.$copy};
`;
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Recommended convention - all composable styles (even custom ones we just created) are prefixed with `$` to clearly indicate that they are composable.

We can also continue composing styles even further if needed.

Eg we can call `.underline` on `theme.$copy` to compose it into a link style.

```tsx
const UIBlogPostLink = styled.a`
  ${typo.$copy.underline};
`;
```

{/* 

// We define common rules for our animations (duration, easing)
const baseAnimation = animation.duration("150ms").easeInOut;

export const animations = {
  // And compose it into specific animations
  fadeIn: baseAnimation.properties({ opacity: [0, 1] }),
  slideUp: baseAnimation.properties({ y: [10, 0] }),
};

// Or continue composing inside components
const UILink = styled.a`
  ${typo.copy.underline};
`;

const UIQuote = styled.blockquote`
  ${typo.copy.italic};
  ${animations.slideUp.duration("500ms")};
`;
``` */}
