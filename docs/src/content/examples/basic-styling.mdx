#Basic Styling

At the core of `stylings` are *composers*. Composers are infinitely chainable style builders.

```tsx
import { $flex, $font } from "stylings";

$flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2);
$font.family("Inter, sans-serif").size("1rem").lineHeight("1.5").underline.center;
$animation.properties({ opacity: [0, 1] }).duration("100ms").easeInOut;
```

> [!NOTE]
> 
> All style composers are prefixed with `$` to easily distinguish them from other objects.

## Basic Usage with styled-components

Composers can be directly passed to styled components.

```tsx
import styled from "styled-components";
import { $flex, $animation } from "stylings";

function App() {
  return <UICard>Card</UICard>;
}

const UICard = styled.div`
  ${$flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2)};

  /* Fade in animation */
  ${$animation.properties({ opacity: [0, 1] }).duration("100ms")};
`;
```

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Composers are heavily cached. Using the same chain multiple times will always be reused.
> ```tsx
> $flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2) === $flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2) // true
> ```

## Extracting styles out of composers

> [!NOTE]
> 
> You will rarely have to do this, as in the majority of cases it will happen automatically, e.g., when the composer is passed to styled components.

Under the hood, the main goal of the composer is to collect styles based on the chain of methods and getters used.

When ready, you can compile the composer, and it will return a simple array of styles (with some exceptions, e.g., when using animations).

To compile the composer, you simply call it as a function or use its `compile()` method.

```tsx
import { $flex } from "stylings";

const composer = $flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2);
const output = composer();
// or
const output = composer.compile();

console.log(output); // ~["display: flex;", "flex-direction: row;", "align-items: center;", "gap: 1rem;"]
```
