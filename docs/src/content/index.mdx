# Quick start

`stylings` is an opinionated and joyful library that helps you write semantic, composable, reusable styles using `React` and `styled-components`.

It is battle-tested and used in production at [Screen Studio](https://screen.studio).

## Goals & Motivation

- Joyful and productive developer experience  
-  Easy to maintain a consistent design language  
-  Allows rapid iterations over UI code  
-  Semantic styling - i.e., code should not only describe how something looks, but also what it is  
-  Good debugging experience in devtools  
-  Makes opinionated and automated choices on common styling patterns  
-  Simple, chainable, composable API that is enjoyable to use  
-  Automate some styling tasks (e.g., generate hover color variants)

## Quick start

Install `stylings` and use it to start styling your applications.

<Steps>
### Install `stylings`

```sh npm2yarn
npm i stylings
```

### Compose your first styles

```tsx filename="styles.ts" {4, 8}
import { $flex, $animation } from 'stylings'

// Compose styles using chainable API
$flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2)

// Create reusable styles and organize them how you like
const animations = {
  $fadeIn: $animation.properties({ opacity: [0, 1] }).duration("100ms").easeInOut,
}
```

### Pass your styles to your styled components

```tsx filename="Component.tsx" {6-7}
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { $flex } from 'stylings';
import { animations } from './styles';

const Intro = styled.div`
  ${animations.$fadeIn};
  ${$flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2)};
`;

function App() {
  return (
    <Intro>
      Hello World
    </Intro>
  )
}
```

### Pass styles to inline components for rapid iteration and reduced boilerplate

```tsx filename="Component.tsx" {6,8}
import { UI, $flex } from 'stylings';
import { animations } from './styles';

function App() {
  return (
    <UI.div styles={[animations.$fadeIn, $flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2)]}>
      Hello World
    </UI.div>
  )
}
```

Inline components accept all the same props as the regular `div`, `span`, `button`, etc. tags.

### Create named inline components for more semantic styling

Next to "how it looks," define "what it is" by naming your inline components. The name will also be visible in devtools for a better debugging experience.

```tsx filename="Component.tsx" {6,8}
import { UI, $flex } from 'stylings';
import { animations } from './styles';

function App() {
  return (
    <UI.MyAppIntro styles={[animations.$fadeIn, $flex.horizontal.alignCenter.gap(2)]}>
      Hello World
    </UI.MyAppIntro>
  )
}
```

You can dynamically access `UI.AnyComponentNameYouWant` as needed. Dynamic components are cached. For one name, the component will be created only once.

You can use the convention `UI.Name_tag`, e.g., `UI.MyLink_a`, to create components with a different tag than `div`. (TypeScript will automatically infer the correct types based on this convention)
