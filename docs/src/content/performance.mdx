# Performance

Stylings primitives are heavily optimized for performance.

```tsx
import { $flex } from "stylings";

console.time("flex");

for (let i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
  $flex.gap(i).vertical.alignCenter.justifyAround.compile();
}

console.timeEnd("flex");
// flex: 393.7880859375 ms
// M3 Max MacBook Pro
```

This is not very advanced benchmark, but in this example:

- we are creating 1 million of different styles
- we exit cached path early (as `.gap()` is used at the start with a new value)
- we use bunch of modifiers and then compile it into the final CSS
